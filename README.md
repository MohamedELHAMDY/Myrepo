Agile Final Project

Overview
This project is a demonstration of Agile principles and practices applied to the development of a back-end product catalog for an e-commerce website. The project includes user story creation, sprint planning, and execution using a Kanban board.

Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to simulate Agile workflows by creating and managing user stories, refining the backlog, planning sprints, and executing tasks during a mock sprint.

Key Features
Create, retrieve, update, and delete products in a catalog.
Like and dislike products.
List and query products in the catalog.
Host the application in the cloud with automated deployments.
Tools Used
GitHub Projects: For creating and managing the Kanban board.
Kanban Board: To organize tasks into Icebox, Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, In Progress, Review/QA, and Done.
Acceptance Criteria: Written in Gherkin syntax to define the "Definition of Done" for user stories.
Stakeholder Requirements
Ability to create a product in the catalog.
Ability to retrieve a product from the catalog.
Ability to update a product in the catalog.
Ability to delete a product from the catalog.
Ability to like a product in the catalog.
Ability to dislike a product in the catalog.
Ability to list all products in the catalog.
Ability to query a subset of products in the catalog.
Hosted in the cloud.
Automated deployment for new changes.
Kanban Board
The project tasks are managed using a Kanban board divided into:

Icebox: Contains issues that are not yet ready for the sprint.
Product Backlog: Ranked list of user stories to be addressed in future sprints.
Sprint Backlog: Stories selected for the current sprint.
In Progress: Stories currently being worked on.
Review/QA: Stories awaiting validation.
Done: Completed stories.
The Kanban board URL: Kanban Board Link (replace # with your link).

Project Workflow
Backlog Creation:
User stories were created for each stakeholder requirement and organized into the Product Backlog.

Backlog Refinement:
Stories were ranked based on priority and refined with acceptance criteria in Gherkin syntax.

Sprint Planning:
A sprint milestone was created, and the top-priority stories were added to the Sprint Backlog with story points.

Sprint Execution:
Tasks were moved across the Kanban board through different stages (In Progress → Review/QA → Done).

Burndown Chart:
A burndown chart was used to track progress and ensure the sprint was on track.
